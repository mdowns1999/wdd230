            <p>The Nike page is a good example of white space and clean design. For example,
                throughout the home page we see some how each section has its own spot is is nicely spaced out. They
                probably used Grid or Flex-box to have each section evenly spread out.
            </p>
            <p>Near the bottom of the page, we see some selections for kids, shoes, clothing, and featured items. Each
                topic listed is evenly spread out and not too close together. They give enough space where they are not
                trying to fill space, but rather fill the section with the least amount of information as possible while
                still making it effective.</p>
