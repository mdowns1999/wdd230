            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <p class="title-1">Nike</p>

            <p>The Nike page is a good example of white space and clean design. For example,
                throughout the home page we see some how each section has its own spot is is nicely spaced out. They
                probably used Grid or Flex-box to have each section evenly spread out.
            Near the bottom of the page, we see some selections for kids, shoes, clothing, and featured items. Each
                topic listed is evenly spread out and not too close together. They give enough space where they are not
                trying to fill space, but rather fill the section with the least amount of information as possible while
                still making it effective.</p>

            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <p class="title-2">Disney</p>
            <a href="https://disneyplus.com" target="_blank"> disneyplus.com </a>
            <img src="images/rsz_1disney-.jpg" alt="Disney Plus Website Page">
            <p>The Disney + page is a good example of repetition. The reason why is because the logo of the site is
                almost everywhere. They place it at the top of the page, you can see it in the background, and you also
                see it on most of the shows in the selection. It definetly lets you know that you are on their streaming
                site!</p>

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <p class="title-3">Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</p>
            <a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org"> churchofjesuschrist.org </a>
            <img src="images/rsz_church_website.jpg" alt="Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Website Page">
            <p>This website demonstrates Hick's Law. Hick's law is basically making the selection for the user easier by
                not having too many options to choose from. If we look at the home page, we see that the church lets you
                choose from four different menu items. After choosing one item, more options will become avaiable for
                you to choose. Thus we see that the user will not have to see every option he or she can choose. but
                rather will only see the options that they want to see.</p>
